# Otterscan DevNet for Anvil

[![Deployment](https://github.com/0xMetacrypt/otterscan-devnet/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/0xMetacrypt/otterscan-devnet/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)

This is a simple hosted version of [Otterscan](https://github.com/otterscan/otterscan) running against _your_ local Anvil instance. It's a great way to have a block explorer for your local DevNet without installing or managing Otterscan or any other software yourself.

## Deployment

This instance is directly deployed using GitHub Pages, with the GitHub Action in this repo. It always uses the latest version in `develop` to deploy the Otterscan instance.

The deployments are not automated at the moment, however I intend to do it frequently or when new features are introduced in Otterscan.

## Support

Go support [Otterscan](https://github.com/otterscan/otterscan), they are the ones doing the amazing work!
